# Validator Staking
Stake NBN in your validator
---

Once you have the validator node set up complete, you must stake an initial pledge of 100 NBN into your validator in order for it to become a candidate for block production.  The process for selection of Validator Nodes to become "active" is dependent on several factors, including penalty scores as well as the amount of NBN staked into the 
validator.  The more you stake, the higher probability of being elected as an active validator to generate blocks and earn PoS block generation rewards.

For details on how validator nodes are selected to be active validator nodes, see the
[whitepaper](https://nibirunet.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nibiru_Whitepaper_V2.1.pdf).
